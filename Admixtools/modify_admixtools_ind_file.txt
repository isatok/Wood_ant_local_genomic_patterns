# how to build this sample table is described in 3_Sample_table&groups_files.sh

# paste the first column of admixtools' .ind file (=vcf sample id's) and the fourth column of $FULLSAMPLE (species by geo) by the first column in both (vcf sample id)

#IF
#I have two tables, table_1 has two columns: vcf_id with values 1,3,5,6 and second with other unnecessary information. Table_2 has also two columns: vcf_id with values 3,6,5,1, 
#and species with values aqu lug prat aqu. I want to paste these tables so that the order of table_1 is kept, while I paste them based on the vcf_id values
#THEN
