# Start the actual analysis here. 
# Read https://github.com/kr-colab/ReLERNN & https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/37/6/1790/5741419?login=false

# Use VCFs in the local barriers analysis folder:

cd /scratch/project_2001443/barriers_introgr_formica_112024/vcf/filt --> 
DP8.93inds.AN10.noScaff0003.mac2.vcf.gz       # Then thin w 1kb, add exsecta, select inds -> NJtree; thin w 20kb -> neighbournet


#Select some number of aqu samples, maybe at least the five with least missing data that were used in other analyses:

# From ABBABABA WINDOWS:
# Copy the simple indset used for Fbranch (5 least missing data inds per species, all Finnish except F. polyctena, for which inds were selected from Switzerland & maximising the number of pops)
# for comparisons (lug aqu<-pol), (rufa pol<-aqu), and (lug pol<-prat)

cp /scratch/project_2001443/barriers_introgr_formica/dsuite/indset_simple_189milSNPs.csv . 
grep -v "xxx" indset_simple_189milSNPs.csv > abwind.simple.pops.txt  # 25 inds + outgroup (rufa, pol, aqu_fi, lug, prat, Outgroup)

#Modify the test script to suit the actual analysis:
cd $SCRATCH/ReLERNN/example_pipeline.sh
#BUT ACTUALLY CREATE A RELERNN DIR INTO THE BARRIERS INTROGR FOLDER AND ANALYSE THERE - NOT DIRECTLY IN SCRATCH/RELERNN, TO KEEP SOME ORDER !
