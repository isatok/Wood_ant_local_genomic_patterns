### Neighbour-joining tree
###

#Either create the tree using dataset *with missing data*
njs(X, fs = 15)
#https://rdrr.io/cran/ape/man/njs.html
#X: a distance matrix.
#fs: argument s of the agglomerative criterion: it is coerced as an integer and must at least equal to one.

#Or create the tree with *no missing data*
nj(X)
#X: a distance matrix; may be an object of class “dist”.

## Follow Sean's recent NJ pipeline in

#the data seems to be needed to be in phylip format "variants_only_108_VCF_MAC2_minQ30_maxmiss1.0.recode.min4.phy"
#converted from VCF. apply mac2 filtering, and they did this with no missing data. BUT WHAT IS THE MIN4 FILTERING?

#The VCF file was converted to phylip format using the script vcf2phylip (28).  E. M. Ortiz, vcf2phylip v2.0: 
#convert a VCF matrix into several matrix formats for phylogenetic analysis (2019; https://zenodo.org/record/2540861).

### Try this out with the phased dataset since it has no missing data (imputed) and it has the outgroup.

#See if I can find duplicates:

########OK SO EXSECTA HAS DUPLICATES. NEED TO FILTER ONLY BIALLELIC SNPS... NO, NEED ONLY ONE ALLELE PER SITE. HOW TO DO BETTER GENOTYPING?

### ASTRAL - maybe not to be used after all?
###

Does it go like this:

# 1) Take the genome annotation file (& scp it to Puhti)
/Users/inaukkar/Downloads/Faqxpol_genome_annotation_v1.gff3.gz
ANNOT=Faqxpol_genome_annotation_v1.gff3.gz

# 2) Extract gene regions from there https://www.biostars.org/p/98725/
gff2bed < annotations.gff | grep -w 'gene' | cut -f1-4 > genes.bed

# 3) Use the gene coordinates to build gene trees https://github.com/simonhmartin/genomics_general#trees-for-sliding-windows,
# maybe with "window can be defined based on genomic coordinates (--windType coord)", no outgroup (unrooted), all non-admixed samples

# 4) Use ASTRAL to make a phylogeny from these gene trees https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL
java -jar astral.5.7.8.jar -i in.tree -o out.tre 2>out.log
# also include "-a" option: When multiple individuals from the same species are available, you can ask ASTRAL to force them to be together in the species tree. 
# To do this, a mapping file needs to be provided using the -a option: one species per line; species_name [number of individuals] individual_1 individual_2 ...

#QUESTIONS:
# Can I use my imputed and phased SNP-data to build the gene trees? Is it correct to define the tree regions by using "gene" annotations from the annotation file?
